# MusicPlayer

This is a Music Player in C# using WPF.

Very simple one, it is attachable to windows default "open with" and now only reproduces .mp3 files.

Has this features: drag and drop folders or songs, play-pause and volume control.

Future features planned (see issues), if you want to contribute feel free to fork and implement! :)
